# ExpenseTracker

A simple application that allows you to track your expenses.
You can enter a new expense by specifying its name, category, price and expense date.
Expenses are stored in the database using the SQLite database.
You can view statistics such as total expenses and a pie chart.
Additionally, you can delete the expenses entered so far at any time.

In the future, I plan to improve this application introducing features such as editing or deleting a individual expense, displaying a list of all expenses, and add more statistics and charts.
